#Notes

# I didn't use any framework/library.
# I have used the "Droid Serif" font instead of the "Calluna" font because it is a paid font.
# There are some places where I have added inline background images because those are usually managed through a CMS and couldn't be managed if they were in CSS.
# For social icons, I have used svg icons.

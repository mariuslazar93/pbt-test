# Instructions
* Open index.html file it's enough.
* For future development, use the "npm install" command and run "gulp development" in the cmd

# Notes
* I didn't use any framework/library.
* I have used the "Droid Serif" font instead of the "Calluna" font because it is a paid font.
* There are some places where I have added inline background images because those are usually managed through a CMS and couldn't be managed if they were in CSS.
* For social icons, I have used svg icons.
